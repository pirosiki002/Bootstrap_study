    <p>
      Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine <a href="#">molluscs</a> of the order
      Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes squid,
      octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the
      cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.Cuttlefish have large,
      W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated
      suckers, with which they secure their prey. They generally range in size
      from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest species, the giant
      cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over
      10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[2]

      Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and
      other cuttlefish. Their predators include dolphins, larger fish (including
      sharks), seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life
      expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to
      indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[3]
      Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all
      invertebrates.[3]
